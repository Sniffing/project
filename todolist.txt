Code
- make contours a single line, not a double line
- more contour joining
- find out interpolation to make landscapes look good (euclidean distance)
- Find out an appropriate distance measure
- make a new drawing and add a typical contours in to estimate a threshold
- take a picture of table and find out if contours can be found
- alignment of webcam and openGL camera with calibration
- histogram differencing

Report
- Add images about LandscapAR
- write about the augmented sandbox
- Consider Thinning and Hit and Miss Morphology
- Redo the Image Ratioing section because it's not right

Running tests on amount of closing operations
(Proved futile because closing is idempotent)

Runnin tests on structuring element, 5 seems to be best, 7 is too wide
and joins stuff it shouldn't. 3 works best on Normal lines, 5 can still
work it just doenst capture the double boundary on a drawn line

Doing distancetransforms is fukin retarded in opencv
